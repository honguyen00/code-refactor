(You can access our website by clicking this link: https://honguyen00.github.io/week-1-challenge/)

## Description

This is is a given project where the aim is to improve the website's accessibility through fulfilling a list of criterias from our client.
By refactoring the site, not only does we success in optimizing the site for search engines but we are also able to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.

One challenge that we face for our design is that we are unable to make elements responsive so that the web application is optimized for any screen size and we plan to fix that in the near future.

## Usage
The Horiseon website lists all the information about the business's services and all the possible benefits for choosing to use the service. By using the navigation bar, users can navigate through the content of each service that has to offer.
